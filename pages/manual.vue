          <h2>My Working Style</h2>
          
          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>I value clear, direct communication. I prefer to discuss complex issues synchronously (video calls or in-person), while using asynchronous channels (email, messaging) for updates and simpler matters.</p>
          <p>I respond best to specific feedback rather than vague direction. If something isn't working, I appreciate knowing exactly what the issue is so we can address it effectively.</p>
          
          <h3>Collaboration</h3>
          <p>I thrive in collaborative environments where ideas can be shared openly. I believe the best solutions emerge when different perspectives are considered.</p>
          <p>I'm comfortable taking the lead on projects but equally happy supporting others. My goal is always to ensure the best outcome, regardless of who gets credit.</p>
          
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>I follow a structured yet flexible process:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Discovery</strong>: Understanding the problem space, user needs, and business constraints</li>
            <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Clarifying goals, scope, and success metrics</li>
            <li><strong>Design</strong>: Iterative exploration of solutions, from low to high fidelity</li>
            <li><strong>Development</strong>: Translating designs into functional implementations</li>
            <li><strong>Delivery</strong>: Launching and measuring impact</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I believe in adapting this process to fit the specific needs of each project rather than rigidly following a formula.</p>
          
          <h3>Feedback</h3>
          <p>I view feedback as a gift and essential to producing great work. I prefer receiving feedback:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Early and often throughout the process</li>
            <li>Focused on objectives rather than subjective preferences</li>
            <li>With context about why something isn't working</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Working With Me</h2>
          
          <h3>What I Need to Do My Best Work</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear objectives and constraints</li>
            <li>Access to users or user research when possible</li>
            <li>Regular check-ins to ensure alignment</li>
            <li>Autonomy to explore solutions within agreed parameters</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>What You Can Expect From Me</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Thoughtful, user-centered solutions</li>
            <li>Clear communication about progress and challenges</li>
            <li>A focus on business outcomes, not just aesthetics</li>
            <li>Honest feedback when I see potential issues</li>
            <li>A commitment to delivering high-quality work on time</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>My Availability</h3>
          <p>I'm typically available during standard business hours (9am-5pm EAT). I check emails and messages regularly throughout the day and aim to respond within 24 hours.</p>
          <p>For urgent matters, direct messaging or calls are the best way to reach me.</p>
